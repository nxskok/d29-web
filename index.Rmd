Welcome to the home page for STA 1007 / STAD29. This is the place to look for things course-related (notes, announcements etc., linked above) except for lecture videos, assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).


## News (newest first)

- 2021-04-02 15:05: I forgot a couple of things this week: the assignment 9's were graded in the usual double-quick time by Bo, which you probably discovered even though I never actually said, and I also forgot to post [my solutions](a9.pdf).

- 2021-04-02 15:00: the course evaluation period is now open, until April 12. You should have a personalized link in your email, or there is a "Course Evals" tab in Quercus. Please take a few minutes to fill out your evaluation of this course. If you liked the course,  your comments will help show that to my departmental committee. If you didn't like the course, or some part of it, your *constructive* feedback will help me make the course better next time. Saying that you hated the course without saying how it could be better doesn't help anyone; in fact, reflecting on the course and your own experience in it will help *you* improve your own learning in the future.

- 2021-03-22 14:45: The assignment 8 grades are up. I notice that Bo has been rather generous with the 10s this week. Here are [my solutions](a8.pdf).

- 2021-03-19 21:00: 
  - the remaining lectures are up. There are *no* lectures for weeks 11 and 12. I figure you have worked hard enough. There will (eventually) be an Assignment 10, due in week 11, and then you will be done with this course! 
  - having said that, the week 10 lectures are a little over 2 hours altogether, so I have given you a bit more to watch in week 10, in return for having nothing to watch after that. This means that everything we do is on an assignment somewhere.

- 2021-03-17 15:00: I changed my plan slightly: the factor analysis got split into two, so there will be a 10a, 10b, and 10c. But everything is otherwise the same.

- 2021-03-17 10:00: here's the plan for the rest of the way: I'm going to record two lectures for week 10, 10a on factor analysis and 10b on frequency tables, then there will be an assignment 10 due in week 11 on those, and *then we will be done*. (This is as far as I usually get face-to-face; I think I go a little faster recording the lectures, though I try not to.) I am steering clear of having anything due in the last week so that you can concentrate on term papers and so on that you might have in other courses, or get ready for exams that  you might have in other courses.

- 2021-03-15 13:00: Assignment 7 has been graded and the grades are published. Here are [my solutions](a7.pdf). 

- 2021-03-14 19:15: for those of you outside Canada (or for those of you inside who haven't noticed yet), we are now on Daylight Time (UTC minus 4). This means that your assignments, live classes etc are an hour earlier until *you* go onto Daylight Time (if you do). In my courses, I'm not going to quibble about assignments being an hour late, but you will need to make sure you have the right time for your tutorial.

- 2021-03-10 20:50: The second lecture for week 9 is now up (that's next week, so you don't have to stress about it yet). I have discovered a couple of things: I seem to be going faster recording lectures like this than when I do them in person, and therefore I'm near the end of the stuff I wanted to talk about. There is material on multidimensional scaling that I usually skip (and am skipping this time), and there are also slides on time series analysis that I am not sure about including. After that there is factor analysis (week 10) and frequency table analysis (week 11), and after that I'm tempted to call it a course. Maybe I'll record a lecture on time series at the end and put it up, but it won't be on any assignments. I'd like to delay assignment 10 to week 11 so that I can put a bit more on it, but we'll see how that goes. I am now around to where I had to hurriedly start recording lectures last year. I suspect it will be better if I record new ones for you this year, but I may watch the old ones to see how bad they are.

- 2021-03-08 12:00: [My solutions](a6.pdf) to Assignment 6. Assignment 7 opens tomorrow. There appears to be a problem accessing some of my older data files today, the ones with URLs beginning `www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/`, such as the ones in PASIAS. I will keep an eye on that. (Newer data files, such as the ones in assignments, are on `ritsokiguess.site` and those are not affected.) The error is a "server error" which suggests it is temporarily down. (Added 13:05: it is back.)

- 2021-03-06 14:00: Some new things up: the second part of cluster analysis (lecture 8b) and a half-hour lecture on making maps in R using the `leaflet` package (inspired by the awfulness of the maps at the end of the second part of the cluster analysis slides). The maps lecture is lecture 9a. I don't have slides or PASIAS problems for lecture 9a, but you should be able to follow along by looking at the code, which I *have* shared. There is also an Assignment 8 on cluster analysis, due March 18, with two questions. One of them is very straightforward, while the other one might make you think a bit.

- 2021-03-03 11:30: the lecture slides for cluster analysis (which I am about to record the second part of) and for discriminant analysis have been recently updated, so if you have an old copy of the notes for those sections, you might like to re-download that. (If you download the slides using the link next to the video, this will probably not apply to you, but if things look inconsistent between your version and mine, that's the reason.)

- 2021-03-01 17:45: in response to a request from tutorial today, [my solutions to assignment 5](a5.pdf). I seemed to need the reminder to post them this week. The assignment this week is on repeated measures; just one question this week, but it does go up to part (h). I am realistic enough to guess that a number of you won't get to the next lectures until the assignment is out of the way, but "this week's" lectures are on discriminant analysis. 

- 2021-02-22 12:15: 
  - reminder: we are back to work, with tutorial at 4 today in the usual place. This week's assignment is on the alphabet soup of ANCOVA and MANOVA, which are better described as analysis of covariance (ANOVA when you also have a quantitative explanatory variable) and multivariate analysis of variance (when you have more than one response variable). So it's not just about what type of variables you have, it's also about what role they play.

  - Also, I am about to record the second part of discriminant analysis (next week), but R Studio on my laptop is not cooperating with me, so I am rebooting the laptop in the hopes that it will improve things.

- 2021-02-19 20:30: in a desperate attempt to get ahead, I've put the first lecture of week *7* up on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca). Week 6 is short, just one lecture, but week 7 will gain a second lecture once I have recorded that. The assignment for week 6, which you most likely don't care about yet, is up (and has only one question). 

- 2021-02-16 22:10: sorry, forgot to post my [assignment 4 solutions](a4.pdf).

- 2021-02-16 15:30: I got my headphones back from my daughter, so Lecture 6a is now recorded and up on Quercus. It came out to an hour and four minutes, but I think you'll find it rather dense because there are a lot of ideas in there. With that in mind, I will see whether I want to add to that for week 6. I plan to record the lecture on Discriminant Analysis later this week and see where it belongs, or whether I do better to split it in two and share it out between weeks 6 and 7. We'll see.

- 2021-02-16 11:00: 
  - reading week greetings. I am planning to record lecture 6a, on repeated measures, later today. This develops out of the MANOVA stuff that is in lecture 5b. I have just finished tinkering with [the slides](bProfile_slides.pdf); the new version of those will be up by the time you read this. I was going to record the lecture this morning, but my daughter has stolen my headphones, so I will be stealing them back later to record your lecture! The slides had a few instances of `gather` (the old version of `pivot_longer`) and `spread` (the old version of `pivot_wider`), so I had to correct those. Also, there is some "mixed models" stuff that I wanted to show you (another, more modern, way to do repeated measures).
  - There may or may not eventually be a lecture 6b. The next piece is on discriminant analysis, which I recall being fairly substantial, so that all of it, or some of it, may get left for week 7.
  - I have some time Wednesday (tomorrow) afternoon to hold a pseudo-tutorial, aka time for questions or to chat. Let me know via e-mail if you would like me to do that. I'm thinking 4:00pm.

- 2021-02-11 14:30: Next week is reading week, so there are no lectures, assignments etc. for you to be responsible for that week. I was hoping to have a tutorial on Monday, but that is Family Day and I am not available then. I should be available later in the week if you want to chat. I'll let you know. At this point, I'm sure you don't want to know about assignment 5, but that is up now and will become available *on the Tuesday of reading week*, in case you want to get an early start on it. (You have the usual, hopefully generous, five hours to work on it). It will be due the Thursday after reading week (the 25th). Assignment 5 has two questions that I made as short as I reasonably could.

- 2021-02-10 11:30 edited 11:50: Lecture 5b is recorded, and will go up later in the usual places. It also seems to have come out to about 40 minutes, so I think that's about enough for this week. This lecture might be more challenging for you than 5a is, since 5b has some ideas that will definitely be new to you, and you may need some time to absorb them. Edited to add: the lecture is up in the usual places linked from Quercus.

- 2021-02-09 13:25: Lecture 5a is up. It came out to 38 minutes, which was a bit longer than I expected, but I did some extra talking. Feel free to watch at faster speed if you prefer. Also, assignment 4 is open. I gave you 5 hours this time; I don't think you'll need as long as that. 

- 2021-02-09 11:45: I wanted to give you a lighter week of lectures this week, and thus a lighter assignment the week after reading week (since I'm guessing you'll have midterms in at least some of your other courses). The sections on analysis of covariance and multivariate analysis of variance are only 20 slides each, so I think we can do those two and call it a week. Analysis of covariance is really another look at regression (and has something in common with the regression with categorical variables that we did in C32), while multivariate analysis of variance will be new to you, but there are only a smallish number of ideas in it at this stage.

- 2021-02-08 14:30: Assignment 3 is graded and the grades are posted. Here are [my solutions](a3.pdf).

- 2021-02-04 11:00: the timing on this week's assignment is what Quercus says: 4 hours. I didn't check the time on the document with the questions in it. Sorry.

- 2021-02-02 15:00: next week's assignment 4 is ready to go. It has two questions, both going up to (f), which is about as short as I could make it while still giving you a decent engagement with the subject matter (that is to say, this week's lectures).

- 2021-02-01 11:00: The assignment 2s have been graded. I am about to post the marks. Note that there are comments, but they are in "question 1" of the quiz, not next to the overall mark as you might have expected. The comments that I saw refer you back to [my solutions](a2.pdf), so read with these to see what could have been done better (so that you will know for another time).

- 2021-01-31 21:45: the two lectures for week 4 are up. I had hoped they would come out shorter, but they ended up not doing so. So I owe you a short week *next* week. The first part of part a is review, and part b is where it gets a bit more complicated. There seem to be a lot of PASIAS problems on contrasts (the end of part b) for some reason.

- 2021-01-29 12:20: if you are thinking about switching to R Studio on your own computer (perhaps because you are running short of free hours on `rstudio.cloud`), the instructions for doing so are in the C32 notes: pages 15 and on of [this](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/running_R_slides.pdf). It is more work to get set up, but once you are up and running there are no limits on anything: run it as much as you like.

- 2021-01-28 13:50: 
  - next week's Assignment 3 is up. It is rather long again, but one of the questions is really entirely straightforward (if you understand what you are doing, you ought not to have any trouble with it). 
  - since I've given you a heavy load so far, I want to give you a lighter week (in terms of lectures next week and the assignment following the week after). The material is called "analysis of variance revisited". This is a review of the anova stuff we did in C32, followed by some work on two-way anova and contrasts. Some of this might be familiar from B27 (or your equivalent course). I haven't recorded this yet; my daughter's room is cold today, so she is in my "recording studio" getting warmed up. Also, she has stolen my headphones. All of this is to say that I don't yet know how long that will come out, maybe an hour or so. The following section, on analysis of covariance, is short and not hard. Some of that will make up next week's lectures, and some of *that*, but not all of it, will feature in Assignment 4.
  - even though we started late, we still have a reading week, the same week it was: the week of February 15 (and thus after week 5, rather than the usual, after week 6). There will be no lectures to watch that week, and no assignment due. I might still have a tutorial if anyone wants to come by and chat. (It's not like any of us are going anywhere.) For me, the reading week doesn't get a number, so the course Week 6 is Feb 22-26. (If I number the reading week, the course appears to have 13 weeks and I get confused.)

- 2021-01-27 15:10: I have finished putting together (and shortening, not that you will believe it) an Assignment 3 for you on Lectures 3a and 3b. There are two longish questions again, because that's how things come out in this course. I will *try* to give you a less heavy Week 4, but I suspect there will still be a lot of things to ask about.

- 2021-01-26 12:30: Lecture 3b is up in the usual places (see the Week 3 Lecture videos page on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca)). Assignment 3 (next week) will be on the lecture 3a and 3b stuff. There is a little more than 2 times 50 minutes, so I will aim to give you a little less next week.

- 2021-01-25 13:15: 
  - I just put up Assignment 2. This will be available to you tomorrow morning, and is due Thursday night. The nature of assignments in this course is that the questions have a largish number of parts, because there are usually several things to work through, some of which are easy and some of which will require some thinking. I have, I hope, given you a generous time limit this time. There are two questions this week, as there usually will be because there are typically two main ideas in the week's lectures that I want you to understand.
  - Lecture 3a is up already (I recorded it last week). It seems likely that Lecture 3b will go up tomorrow. This is on survival analysis. It might be a bit long, but I will record it and see how long it comes out. My tendency in this course is to go fairly slowly since there are a lot of ideas. You can always (at least on YouTube) speed up the playback if it is going too slowly for you.

- 2021-01-24 21:35: The assignment 1s have been marked and the grades are up. Here are [my solutions](a1.pdf). It looks as if most people did well, but be warned: this was kind of a warmup, and the next assignment you will probably find (a) longer and (b) more difficult in comparison to this one.

- 2021-01-20 17:05: I decided to record the third and last part of logistic regression today while I had everything set up (and the ideas were still fresh in my mind). You don't need to watch it until next week, however. The trouble with downloading the videos appears to be at my end; if that happens to you, the advice is the usual reboot, delete cookies etc. (For me, Brave doesn't like mymedia, Chrome was working until today, and Firefox is still working.) The next material after this is survival analysis; I would like to keep this together in one recording, but I fear it might go a bit long. I'll make a call  about that next week.

- 2021-01-20 14:20: the second part of this week's lecture is also up. There will be a third part of logistic regression, but I will save that for next week. (Thus, assignment 2 will be based on what you see there now.) At this moment, the direct download is not working, because of a problem with the mymedia site, but I will keep an eye on that.

- 2021-01-19 18:30: the first part of this week's lecture is up on Quercus. Look for a Week 2 Videos page.

- 2021-01-17 21:00: more [reading](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/learnonline/chapter/chapter-1/), this time about online learning.

- 2021-01-16 12:50: some [reading](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1349583012804005889) for you.

- 2021-01-15 21:45: there is an Announcement on Zoom about the Monday tutorial (which is really more like an office hour: bring questions if you have them in preparation for the assignment that is coming). 

  For my other course, I just wrote out a suggested weekly schedule, which seems a little like overkill for this course, but anyway, here's how you might arrange it:
  
  - Monday: if you have questions or confusions about the previous week's material, bring them to tutorial. (If everything is clear, no need to go to tutorial.)
  - Tuesday: pick a time between now and Thursday to work on the week's assignment, some number of hours like 4 or 5 (this will be like C32). Assignments will be open on Tuesday morning and due on Thursday at 11:59pm, and the first one is next week.
  - Wednesday: watch this week's lectures (if you can cope with two hours on one day; if not, split it over two days)
  - Thursday: work through the PASIAS problems for this week's lectures.
  - Friday: rest! (From this course at least.)

- 2021-01-14 20:45: there are now three ways to watch the lecture videos: 
  - using the video viewer on Quercus (as before)
  - downloading the videos and watching them offline using a video player like [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html). This is probably best if you have a shaky internet connection, or are a long way away, since this doesn't require your connection to stay up for any longer than the download takes.
  - on YouTube.
  
  The links to these are next to the lecture videos on Quercus.

- 2021-01-11 15:30: Lecture 1a (course outline) and Lecture 1b (first part of a review of regression) are now up on Quercus. There will be a Lecture 1c to complete the regression review. Assignment 1, when it comes out next week, will be on all of this.
- 2021-01-10 11:50: I corrected a few (small) errors in the [course outline](bOutline_slides.pdf).
- 2021-01-10 11:25: tutorials start on Monday Jan 18: that is to say, not tomorrow but in week 2. I am planning to record a short introduction today, and have the first week of actual material up by Wednesday. There will be an Assignment 1 on this, due on Jan 21. 
- 2021-01-10 11:15: STA 1007 is open on Quercus; its Quercus page should redirect to the D29 one, which is what you'll be using if you are registered in 1007.
- 2021-01-06 15:45: the [course outline](bOutline_slides.pdf) is now up to date.
- 2021-01-05 12:30: the [lecture notes](notes.html) are now arranged by section (to be somewhat less unwieldy).
- 2021-01-04 14:30: the course outline here will need editing to be suitable for this year's version of the course. I will do that later this week.
- 2021-01-04 12:00: here is how I plan to run STAD29 online this year (a lot like STAC32 was):
  - I will record something like 2 hours of lecture material each week and make it available to you on Quercus. In the before-times, this was one two-hour lecture a week, but I may break it up into smaller pieces.
  - there is one hour of tutorial a week, on Monday at 4:00pm (I think it is labelled as a Practical). This is the same idea as C32: bring questions to a Zoom meeting, and we can talk about them. I will put the Zoom link on Quercus. You will find the statistical material to be harder than it was in C32, so make sure to get clarification when you need. 
  - there will also be a Quercus discussion board available for questions. If it is something more personal, you can email me.
  - there will be weekly assignments; your grade is based on the best 8 out of the 10 of them. There isn't officially a project this time.

- 2020-04-29 12:30: If you plan to take your statistical skills into the business world, [this is a good read](https://medium.com/@ODSC/3-data-skills-to-get-hired-in-2020-73b4977bdc6f).
